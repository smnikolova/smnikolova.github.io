<h1> About Me</h1>
<p> I am a developer that has interest in learning new languages and technologies. My work experience has been primarily with C++, perl, C# and I have a lot of experience working with Unix/Linux operating systems. I would love to learn more about different technologies as I want to keep my skills up to date. I am a graduate from UBC with a computer science degree and have been working as a programmer for the last 9 years.</p>
